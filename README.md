# PacFinder
Pathfinding algorithm visualizer with a slight twist: 80s arcade retro theme based on the original Pacman game. The project currently runs using the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm.

# Current Visual Example:  
![pacfinder front page image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78772133/120860445-b08e3800-c553-11eb-875d-1717a44ab25b.PNG)

# How to use:
Clicking and holding on an empty allows the user to draw walls(white). Users can erase a wall by simply re-drawing over it while holding the mouse.
The start(yellow) and end(red) nodes can be moved around by clicking, holding and dragging around the grid.
At the top of the screen, there are two buttons: 1. Visualize the Dijkstra algorithm which will initiate the visualization sequence and 2. Reset Tiles

# Incoming changes
-Additional pathfinding algorithms  
-Dropdown menus and algorithm selection once new algorithms are implemented  
-Site Responsiveness  
-Animations  
-Start/End node icons to be changed into Ghosts/Pacman respectively  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
